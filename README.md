Web Project 1

This project has been developed in two phases for the initial sprints of the Practicum course.
It uses html and css, including iframe embeds, animation and BEM methodology.

With the reviewers advice, I will revisit the Kaufman triangle and cell theme dark blocks to clean up the layout.
Once the base is solid, I could experiment with more transformations and animations!
